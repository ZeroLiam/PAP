# PAP - Phone As Pixel
By Liselot Ramirez. My own implementation for the Phone-as-Pixel project.
Started in the `Summer Semester 2017` at `Bauhaus University` for the `Mobile Information Systems` class.

# Updates
## Future Plans
Like I said, I want to keep maintaining this wiki regardless that my homework deadline is up. I'm learning everyday so there are a couple of ideas I want to implement:
* The new Android Oreo has a multi-display support, and I NEED TO TRY THIS APP THERE!!
* An improved matching/synchronized image by modifying the meta tag with the viewport option and initial-scale. For example, `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
* Develop the version with Google's [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/). This is a JavaScript library with optimized custom web components, so it can be worth a try to cut a part of the canvas and send it to clients. ~~ I really want to try that you guys!! ~~
