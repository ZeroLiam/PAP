# PAP - Phone As Pixel
By Liselot Ramirez. My own implementation for the Phone-as-Pixel project.
Started in the `Summer Semester 2017` at `Bauhaus University` for the `Mobile Information Systems` class.

## Rebuild in SCSS & use Calc
I'm going to rebuild this repository later tonight by modifying slightly my zoom & matching algorithm with the [SCSS techniques](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/css-sprites-revisited/#less-and-sass-to-the-rescue) and the use of [calc()](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/getting-started-css-calc-techniques/) provided by Smashing Magazine - STAY TUNED!
## Future Plans
Like I said, I want to keep maintaining this wiki regardless that my homework deadline is up. I'm learning everyday so there are a couple of ideas I want to implement:
* The new Android Oreo has a **multi-display support**, and **I NEED TO TRY THIS APP THERE!!**
* An improved matching/synchronized image by modifying the meta tag with the viewport option and initial-scale. For example, `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
* Develop the version with Google's [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/). This is a JavaScript library with optimized custom web components, so it can be worth a try to cut a part of the canvas and send it to clients. ~~I really want to try that you guys!!~~
